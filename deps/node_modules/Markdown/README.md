* Ideally should be able to handle case like this \*\*strong \`intersects\*\* backtics\` and
  not produce broken html with intersecting elements.
* Right the thing is not optimized. When it finds a, for example, a code block, it should not look for the same pattern
  in the part of the text before the match. This will save a lot of regex passes.
* Nesting code in ul/ol
* matchRecursive should cache regexes
